In the following, we present some results of benchmarks against which we tested our model. We have looked at two dimensional Poiseuille flow, the four roll mill, and plan to look at the lid driven cavity.

\section{Poiseuille Flow}
Poiseuille flow is a simple physical system which allows us to test how our algorithm treats boundaries and whether the paramaters available to us behave as expected. The physical model is fluid flow between two infinite parallel plates driven by either a pressure gradient or a homogeneous body force. We will use a body force to drive the fluid and the symmetry of the system will allow us to simulate in two dimensions. We take the periodic boundary conditions at the east and west boundaries and no slip walls on the north and south boundaries of the domain.
